# DoomFirePy
PSX Doom Fire effect implemented on Python using Kivy

This code displays a fire animation effect by manipulating pixel colors, based on original PSX Doom implementation.

After implementing the same algorithm on Qt I've comed across the Kivy framework wanted to give it a try. The Doom Fire effect seemed to be the perfect fit for this initial test.

This code is based on the article from:
https://github.com/fabiensanglard/DoomFirePSX/blob/master/flames.html

It uses Kivy framework:
https://kivy.org/
kivy also needs some dependencies installed, follow instruction on kivy site to setup the environment
